Background for Assignment - 
Consider the data set SouvenirSales.xls (1995 Jan -2001 Dec) that gives the monthly sales of souvenir at a shop in New York. Back in 2001, an analyst was appointed to forecast sales for the next 12 months (Year 2002). The analyst portioned the data by keeping the last 12 months of data (year 2001) as validation set, and the remaining data as training set.
